# My DSA Learning Journey in C++

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m ~Saif, a first-year college student beginning my journey into **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**.

## About This Repository

This repo contains my practice code and learning notes as I explore different DSA topics. Each topic has its own folder with the following structure:


Topic/
â”œâ”€â”€ practice/              # Practice code for the topic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ basic_concepts.cpp
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ more_examples.cpp
â””â”€â”€ questions/             # Solved questions for the topic
    â”œâ”€â”€ question1.cpp
    â””â”€â”€ question2.cpp


For example, the `Array/` folder contains:
- Various `.cpp` files where I implement array operations and algorithms.
- A `questions/` folder that contains array-specific problems Iâ€™m solving.

## Why This Repo?

Iâ€™m uploading my code here to:

- Track my progress while learning DSA concepts step by step.
- Practice using **Git** and **GitHub** for version control and collaboration.

## How To Use This Repo

- Feel free to browse through the folders and check out the `.cpp` files.
- If you want to try solving the problems yourself, look inside each topicâ€™s `questions` folder.
- Suggestions and feedback are always welcome!

Thanks for stopping by! Iâ€™m excited to grow and improve with each line of code. ðŸš€
